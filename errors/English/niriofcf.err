3) Cannot conflict with the default alias of another device. A default alias is the name that the NI-RIO Device Driver assigns to a device based on its attributes if you have not assigned a custom alias to the device using MAX or the System Configuration API. For example, 'PXI1Slot3' is the default alias for the device at Slot 3 of PXI Chassis 1, and it cannot be used as an alias name for any other device. Refer to the LabVIEW Help for NI-RIO for more information about aliases.

This RIO session has been opened as a remote session for a RIO target on the local machine.  NI recommends using a local session because remote sessions use network communication. Therefore, you should account for network considerations when designing an application with a remote RIO connection.

Opening a remote RIO session occurs when the resource string is specified as rio://<hostname>/<device_name>.  A local session can be opened by specifying just the <device_name>. More information is available here: https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000004BIiSAM
